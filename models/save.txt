This folder is saving your own models form dowanloading.
I have already put my own traning models and parameters in this folder, you can just download it and use those models and parameters to run 'Evaluate.py'
if you wanna the pre-processing model from the author, please cllick 'http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2018/pcpnet/models.zip' or move to the author's repository.
